            Chicago is known as the "Windy City," but it doesn't actually have
            the windiest weather in the United States. The nickname originated
            in the late 19th century as a metaphorical reference to the city's
            long-winded politicians rather than its weather patterns. The
            Chicago River is famous for being dyed green every year on St.
            Patrick's Day. The tradition began in 1962 when city officials
            accidentally poured 100 pounds of green dye into the river. Today,
            they use an eco-friendly vegetable dye to turn the river a vibrant
            green color. Chicago is home to the first-ever skyscraper. The Home
            Insurance Building, completed in 1885, was the first tall building
            to use a steel frame, allowing it to reach a height of 138 feet.
            While it was demolished in 1931, its innovative design paved the way
            for the modern skyscrapers that define Chicago's skyline today. The
            iconic deep-dish pizza was invented in Chicago. In the 1940s,
            Pizzeria Uno and Pizzeria Due developed the deep-dish style,
            characterized by its thick, buttery crust, generous cheese layer,
            and chunky tomato sauce on top. It has since become a beloved staple
            of Chicago's culinary scene. Chicago is home to one of the largest
            and most diverse collections of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist
            art outside of France. The Art Institute of Chicago houses renowned
            works by artists such as Claude Monet, Georges Seurat, Vincent van
            Gogh, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, making it a must-visit destination
            for art enthusiasts.
