            Chicago is known as the "Windy City," but it doesn't actually have
            the windiest weather in the United States. The nickname originated
            in the late 19th century as a metaphorical reference to the city's
            long-winded politicians rather than its weather patterns. The
            Chicago River is famous for being dyed green every year on St.
            Patrick's Day. The tradition began in 1962 when city officials
            accidentally poured 100 pounds of green dye into the river. Today,
            they use an eco-friendly vegetable dye to turn the river a vibrant
            green color. Chicago is home to the first-ever skyscraper. The
            Home Insurance Building, completed in 1885, was the first tall
            building to use a steel frame, allowing it to reach a height of
            138 feet. While it was demolished in 1931, its innovative design
            paved the way for the modern skyscrapers that define Chicago's
            skyline today. The iconic deep-dish pizza was invented in Chicago.
            In the 1940s, Pizzeria Uno and Pizzeria Due developed the
            deep-dish style, characterized by its thick, buttery crust,
            generous cheese layer, and chunky tomato sauce on top. It has
            since become a beloved staple of Chicago's culinary scene. Chicago
            is home to one of the largest and most diverse collections of
            Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art outside of France. The
            Art Institute of Chicago houses renowned works by artists such as
            Claude Monet, Georges Seurat, Vincent van Gogh, and Pierre-Auguste
            Renoir, making it a must-visit destination for art enthusiasts.
